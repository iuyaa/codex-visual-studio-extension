# Changelog

## 1.3.3 - 2026-07-18

### Deixa o chat mais confiável em modo dock e em janela
- Melhora o funcionamento do painel ao encaixar, soltar ou mover a janela do
  Codex dentro do Visual Studio.
- Aprende qual interface funciona melhor no computador atual e começa por ela
  nas próximas sessões, usando a alternativa automaticamente quando necessário.

  velocidade da versão anterior.

  janela do Visual Studio.
- Adiciona logs de diagnóstico opcionais em **Configurações > Geral**, sem exigir
  reinicialização e sempre desligados por padrão.

  antes de serem compartilhados publicamente.

  automática, nos logs e no pacote de instalação.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-07-11

### Added
- VS Code-style Codex header, composer controls, and accessible settings detail panel.
- Visual Studio command parity for opening the sidebar, starting a new Codex agent, adding editor selections/files to the current thread, running `/review`, and asking Codex to implement selected context.
- Context menu entries for editor selections and Solution Explorer files.
- VS Code-compatible extension settings for composer Enter behavior, follow-up mode, review delivery, and open-on-startup.
- Automated tests for app-server arguments, path containment/indexing, and protected settings persistence.
- Windows CI for locked restore, NuGet audit, tests, warning-free build, VSIX packaging, and package verification.
- Optional release signing through Microsoft's Sign CLI when repository signing credentials are configured.
- Bounded official-WebView history with explicit older-message batches, display-only payload limits, and responsive history controls.
- Manual conversation compaction and optional automatic compaction at 85% context usage.

### Changed
- Enter now sends from the composer by default, while Shift+Enter inserts a newline and Ctrl+Enter remains an explicit send shortcut.
- Updated the integration to the current Codex app-server methods for plugins, reviews, steering, approvals, permissions, elicitation, and logout.
- Updated Visual Studio, WebView2, Newtonsoft.Json, Community Toolkit, and transitive MessagePack dependency baselines.
- Updated the embedded Mermaid bundle to 11.15.0 and added packaged third-party notices.
- Sensitive settings and prompt history are now protected with Windows DPAPI and saved atomically.
- Authentication guidance now makes per-user `codex login` the recommended path, and the official WebView no longer receives `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the Visual Studio process.
- Refreshed fallback model choices from the installed Codex 0.144 catalog, with GPT-5.6 Sol as the default for new settings.
- Localized the new model, IDE-command, history, Markdown, and skill-scope UI across all five supported languages.

### Fixed
- Managed MCP servers now use dotted `-c` overrides accepted by current Codex CLI versions.
- Cancellation, queued follow-ups, one-shot attachments, server restart, and stale process callbacks no longer race each other.
- Solution file search is asynchronous, cached, cancellable, bounded, and excludes generated directories and reparse points.
- Quoted `@file` mentions, paths containing spaces, drive-root containment, and dynamic Markdown fences are handled correctly.
- Mermaid preview navigation, CSP, messages, external links, and URL schemes are restricted to trusted values.
- Package, manifest, assembly, and app-server client versions now share one committed version source.
- Clearing prompt history no longer merges the deleted entries back from disk.
- Settings coordination now uses a deterministic cross-process mutex, while malformed-file preservation no longer mislabels transient I/O failures as corruption.
- PowerShell executable paths, command resolution timeouts, skill directory boundaries, and `.system` scope detection are handled correctly.
- Changing the extension language no longer changes the Visual Studio process culture.
- Rendered Mermaid diagrams are frozen after their first valid layout so inactive messages do not retain WebView2 instances.
- Extremely long conversations no longer hydrate their entire history automatically, and large tool/assistant streams are bounded only in the visual copy.
- WebView event dispatch and UI-thread transitions no longer rely on `async void` or unobserved dispatcher operations.
- The official WebView now receives the active Visual Studio document, active selection, and open tabs using its expected IDE-context contract, with an editor-view fallback while focus is in the chat.
- The requested model and reasoning effort are now supplied as host runtime metadata so the assistant can identify the selected model without exposing synthetic text as the user's message.
- Codex settings now open as an independent document-well tab, leaving chat accessible while changes persist immediately and invalidate every active WebView consumer.
- Recent task history now uses a bounded local-history popover in Visual Studio, avoiding the incompatible cloud-task component without requiring a ChatGPT web-session credential.
- VSIX verification now rejects credential files and private signing material before release.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Updated the VSIX manifests shipped with the extension package.
- Refreshed the packaged extension metadata so the published release carries the new manifest content.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Inline rename for saved conversations in the history lists, preserving the original Codex/GPT thread ID so existing context resumes normally.
- Keyboard shortcut registration for the main `View.VisualCodexStudio` command, with the command exposed through Visual Studio keyboard settings.
- Shared history item template across recent, visible, and full history lists to keep rename and delete actions consistent.

### Changed
- Renamed the extension branding to `Visual Codex Studio`.
- Updated the extension icon used by the VSIX package, installed extensions list, and Marketplace metadata.
- Updated the `View > Codex` command icon to use the custom ChatGPT/Codex visual asset.
- Refined the history UX so saved conversations can carry meaningful labels without affecting their backing thread identity.
- Reworked chat message presentation to use a virtualized list surface instead of rendering the whole conversation in a single stacked panel.
- Buffered assistant output updates and switched large message list refreshes to batch operations to reduce UI churn in long conversations.

### Fixed
- Restored the rate-limit usage indicator as a proper donut chart instead of a stretched shape.
- Fixed the thread rename UI so it no longer breaks tool window loading at runtime.
- Reduced chat layout jumps during interactions such as copying content while keeping markdown rendering and collapse/expand behavior intact.
