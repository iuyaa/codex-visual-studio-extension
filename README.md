# Visual Codex Studio

Run Codex inside Visual Studio without leaving the IDE.

`Visual Codex Studio` is a 64-bit VSIX for Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio
2026. It hosts the local Codex CLI through `codex app-server`, adapts the Codex
WebView to Visual Studio, and connects conversations to the active solution,
editor, theme, and user settings.

Current release: [v1.3.0](https://github.com/rodrigojager/codex-visual-studio-extension/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

## What It Provides

### Codex inside Visual Studio

- Dockable Codex chat in the Visual Studio tool window area.
- Frozen Codex WebView adapted to Visual Studio WebView2, theme resources, locale,
  and the local app-server transport.
- Normal and plan collaboration modes.
- Runtime model discovery with model-specific reasoning options, verbosity,
  service tier, approval policy, and sandbox controls.
- Streaming assistant output, tool activity, approvals, interactive questions,
  Markdown, diffs, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Clipboard and file-picker image attachments sent as app-server `localImage`
  inputs.
- Session usage and rate-limit information when supplied by the Codex runtime.
- Bounded local recent-task history instead of the incompatible cloud-task view.

### Visual Studio context and commands

- Active document, selected text, and open editor tabs are sent through the IDE
  context contract when IDE context is enabled.
- Solution-aware `@file` search is asynchronous, bounded, and excludes generated
  directories and reparse points.
- Editor context-menu commands can add a selection to the current thread, review
  selected code, or ask Codex to implement it.
- Solution Explorer can add the selected file to the current thread.
- Visual Studio commands are available for opening Codex, starting a new agent,
  and opening settings.
- Plan questions use a separate prompt window so the main conversation remains
  visible.

### Settings

- Settings open in an independent Visual Studio document tab, leaving chat
  available at the same time.
- Changes are persisted immediately and invalidate all active chat consumers;
  there is no Apply button or extension restart requirement.
- Configurable executable path, working directory, model, reasoning, verbosity,
  service tier, profile, approvals, sandbox, follow-up behavior, composer Enter
  behavior, review delivery, managed MCP servers, and startup behavior.
- UI localization for English, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, French, and German.
- Visual Studio theme integration for light and dark environments.

### Long-conversation behavior

The extension deliberately avoids materializing an entire large conversation in
the Visual Studio WebView at once:

- Initial history is limited to the most recent 120 turns or 2 MB.
- Older history is loaded explicitly in batches of 20 turns, with a 512 KB batch
  budget.
- Large messages, diffs, tool output, and streams are limited only in the Visual
  Studio display copy. The full content remains in the Codex session history.
- Browser-native lazy rendering reduces work for content outside the visible
  viewport.
- Manual context compaction is available, with optional automatic compaction after
  a completed turn reaches 85% context usage.

These controls improve responsiveness, but they do not make conversation size
unlimited. Runtime, model-context, and machine-resource limits still apply.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio 2026, 64-bit, with the Core Editor workload.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer.
- Codex CLI installed locally and available through `codex`, `codex.cmd`, or the
  executable path selected in extension settings.
- A working per-user Codex login or provider configuration.

The VSIX does not bundle the Codex CLI or an OpenAI account.

## Installation

1. Install the Codex CLI and verify that `codex --version` works in a terminal.
2. Run `codex login` with the ChatGPT account that will use Visual Studio, or
   configure that user's provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
3. Download the VSIX from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rodrigojager/codex-visual-studio-extension/releases/latest)
   or use the Marketplace package when available.
4. Run the VSIX installer and follow its instructions for the desired Visual
   Studio instances.
5. Open Visual Studio and choose `View > Codex`. The canonical command is
   `View.VisualCodexStudio` and can be assigned a keyboard shortcut.

If authentication is missing, the extension's Account settings can open the
local `codex login` flow.

## Authentication and Local Data

Authentication always belongs to the Windows user running Visual Studio. The
recommended path is that user's own `codex login` session. Advanced local setups
can instead use:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` in that user's environment.
- Provider configuration in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- A Codex profile that selects provider-specific configuration.

No ChatGPT cookie, token, API key, `auth.json`, publisher credential, or signing
key is bundled in the repository or VSIX. The WebView is not given
`OPENAI_API_KEY` from the Visual Studio process.

Extension settings are stored at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexVsix\settings.json`, outside
the repository and VSIX. Sensitive extension settings and prompt history are
protected for the current Windows user with DPAPI and written atomically. Codex
authentication and provider configuration remain under that user's Codex home
directory and must never be copied into this repository.

## Configuration Notes

- Provider and profile behavior should be configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- The settings UI supports extra model, reasoning, verbosity, and service-tier
  entries for runtimes that expose options newer than this frozen extension.
- Additional CLI arguments, environment overrides, and raw TOML overrides are
  advanced per-user settings. They are passed to the local runtime and should be
  reviewed before use.
- Attached local images must remain readable until the turn starts.
- The embedded WebView is a frozen bundle. A future Codex CLI or protocol change
  may require source changes that this unmaintained project will not receive.

## Build and Test

Release packaging requires full Visual Studio MSBuild.

```powershell
$vswhere = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe"
$install = & $vswhere -latest -products * -requires Microsoft.Component.MSBuild -property installationPath
$msbuild = Join-Path $install "MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe"

[xml]$props = Get-Content Directory.Build.props -Raw
$version = [string]$props.Project.PropertyGroup.Version

dotnet restore CodexVs2026Extension.sln `
  --locked-mode `
  -p:NuGetAudit=true `
  -p:NuGetAuditMode=all `
  -p:WarningsAsErrors=NU1901%3BNU1902%3BNU1903%3BNU1904

dotnet test CodexVs2026Extension.sln -c Release --no-restore

& $msbuild `
  CodexVsix\CodexVsix.csproj `
  /t:Rebuild `
  /m:1 `
  /nr:false `
  /p:Configuration=Release `
  /p:RestoreLockedMode=true `
  /p:BuildVsixPackage=true

.\scripts\Test-VsixPackage.ps1 `
  -VsixPath CodexVsix\CodexVsix.vsix `
  -ExpectedVersion $version
```

`dotnet build` can compile the projects, but the final VSIX should be produced
with Visual Studio `MSBuild.exe`. The package verifier checks manifest and
assembly versions, required WebView assets, third-party runtime versions,
credential filenames, private signing material, and package signatures.

GitHub CI performs locked restore with NuGet auditing, tests, packaging, and VSIX
verification. Tagged releases are signed only when all repository signing secrets
are configured; otherwise the workflow publishes a verified unsigned package.
Visual Studio Marketplace publication is intentionally manual.
